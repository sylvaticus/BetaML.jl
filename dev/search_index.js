Trained models can be also used to impute missing values in new data with predict(mox,xNew).

The specific method for which trainData, and valData are selected at each iteration depends on the specific sampler, whith a single 5 k-fold rule being the default.\n\nThis approach is very flexible because the specific model to employ or the metric to use is left within the user-provided function. The only thing that cross_validation does is provide the model defined in the function f with the opportune data (and the random number generator).\n\nInput of the user-provided function trainData and valData are both themselves tuples. In supervised models, crossvalidations data should be a tuple of (X,Y) and trainData and valData will be equivalent to (xtrain, ytrain) and (xval, yval). In unsupervised models data is a single array, but the training and validation data should still need to be accessed as  trainData[1] and valData[1]. Output of the user-provided function The user-defined function can return whatever. However, if `returnstatisticsis left on its defaulttrue` value the user-defined function must return a single scalar (e.g. some error measure) so that the mean and the standard deviation are returned.\n\nNote that cross_validation can beconveniently be employed using the do syntax, as Julia automatically rewrite cross_validation(data,...) trainData,valData,rng  ...user defined body... end as cross_validation(f(trainData,valData,rng ), data,...)\n\nExample\n\njulia> X = [11:19 21:29 31:39 41:49 51:59 61:69];\njulia> Y = [1:9;];\njulia> sampler = KFold(nsplits=3);\njulia> (μ,σ) = cross_validation([X,Y],sampler) do trainData,valData,rng\n                 (xtrain,ytrain) = trainData; (xval,yval) = valData\n                 trainedModel    = buildForest(xtrain,ytrain,30)\n                 ŷval            = predict(trainedModel,xval)\n                 ϵ               = relative_mean_error(yval,ŷval,normrec=false)\n                 return ϵ\n               end\n(0.3202242202242202, 0.04307662219315022)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.crossentropy-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.crossentropy","text":"crossentropy(y,ŷ; weight)\n\nCompute the (weighted) cross-entropy between the predicted and the sampled probability distributions.\n\nTo be used in classification problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dcelu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dcelu","text":"dcelu(x; α=1) \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07483.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.delu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.delu","text":"delu(x; α=1) with α > 0 \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07289.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dmaximum-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dmaximum","text":"dmaximum(x) \n\nMultidimensional verison of the derivative of maximum\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dmish-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dmish","text":"dmish(x) \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08681v1.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dplu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dplu","text":"dplu(x;α=0.1,c=1) \n\nPiecewise Linear Unit derivative \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09534.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.drelu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.drelu","text":"drelu(x) \n\nRectified Linear Unit \n\nhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/reluICML.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsigmoid-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsigmoid","text":"dsigmoid(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsoftmax-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsoftmax","text":"dsoftmax(x; β=1) \n\nDerivative of the softmax function \n\nhttps://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-softmax-function-and-its-derivative/\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsoftplus-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsoftplus","text":"dsoftplus(x) \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier(neuralnetworks)#Softplus\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dtanh-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dtanh","text":"dtanh(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.elu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.elu","text":"elu(x; α=1) with α > 0 \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07289.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.entropy-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.entropy","text":"entropy(x)\n\nCalculate the entropy for a list of items (or rows).\n\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisiontreelearning#Gini_impurity\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.generate_parallel_rngs-Tuple{Random.AbstractRNG, Integer}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.generate_parallel_rngs","text":"generate_parallel_rngs(rng::AbstractRNG, n::Integer;reSeed=false)\n\nFor multi-threaded models, return n independent random number generators (one per thread) to be used in threaded computations.\n\nNote that each ring is a copy of the original random ring.

For kmedoids they must be selected within one of the data, for kmeans they are the geometrical center) n a nutshell. Then ( b ) iterate for each point to assign the point to the cluster of the closest representative (according with a user defined distance metric, default to Euclidean), and ( c ) move each representative at the center of its newly acquired cluster (where \"center\" depends again from the metric). Steps ( b ) and ( c ) are reiterated until the algorithm converge, i.e. the tentative k representative points (and their relative clusters) don't move any more. The result (output of the algorithm) is that each point is assigned to one of the clusters (classes). The algorithm in GMMClusterer is similar in that it employs an iterative approach (the ExpectationMinimisation algorithm, \"em\") but here we make the hipothesis that the data points are the observed outcomes of some _mixture probabilistic models where we have first a k-categorical variables whose outcomes are the (unobservble) parameters of a probabilistic distribution from which the data is finally drawn. Because the parameters of each of the k-possible distributions is unobservable this is also called a model with latent variables. Most gmm models use the Gaussain distribution as the family of the mixture components, so we can tought the gmm acronym to indicate Gaussian Mixture Model. In BetaML we have currently implemented only Gaussain components, but any distribution could be used by just subclassing AbstractMixture and implementing a couple of methids (you are invited to contribute or just ask for a distribution family you are interested), so I prefer to think \"gmm\" as an acronym for Generative Mixture Model. The algorithm tries to find the mixture that maximises the likelihood that the data has been generated indeed from such mixture, where the \"E\" step refers to computing the probability that each point belongs to each of the k-composants (somehow similar to the step b in the kmeans/kmedoids algorithms), and the \"M\" step estimates, giving the association probabilities in step \"E\", the parameters of the mixture and of the individual components (similar to step c). The result here is that each point has a categorical distribution (PMF) representing the probabilities that it belongs to any of the k-components (our classes or clusters). This is interesting, as gmm can be used for many other things that clustering. It forms the backbone of the GMMImputer model to impute missing values (on some or all dimensions) based to how close the record seems to its pears. For the same reasons, GMMImputer can also be used to predict user's behaviours (or users' appreciation) according to the behaviour/ranking made by pears (\"collaborative filtering\"). While the result of GMMClusterer is a vector of PMFs (one for each record), error measures and reports with the true values (if known) can be directly applied, as in BetaML they internally call mode() to retrieve the class with the highest probability for each record.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/Clustering - Iris/betaml_tutorial_cluster_iris.html","page":"A clustering task: the prediction of  plant species from floreal measures (the iris dataset)","title":"A clustering task: the prediction of  plant species from floreal measures (the iris dataset)","text":"As we are here, we also try different versions of the BetaML models, even if the default \"versions\" should be fine.

It is used by default for hyperparameters autotuning of the BetaML supervised models. cross_validation works by calling the function f, defined by the user, passing to it the tuple trainData, valData and rng and collecting the result of the function f.

BetaML provides several imputation models in the Imputation module. Note that many of these imputation models can be used for Collaborative Filtering / Recomendation Systems. Models as GMMImputer have the advantage over traditional algorithms as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) that GMM can \"detect\" the hidden structure of the observed data, where some observation can be similar to a certain pool of other observvations for a certain characteristic, but similar to an other pool of observations for other characteristics. Here we use RFImputer. While the model allows for reproducible multiple imputations (with the parameter multiple_imputation=an_integer) and multiple passages trough the various columns (fields) containing missing data (with the option recursive_passages=an_integer), we use here just a single imputation and a single passage. As all BetaML models, RFImputer follows the patters m=ModelConstruction(pars); fit!(m,x,[y]); est = predict(m,x) where est can be an estimation of some labels or be some characteristics of x itself (the imputed version, as in this case, a reprojected version as in PCA), depending if the model is supervised or not. See the API user documentationfor more details. For imputers, the output ofpredictis the matrix with the imputed values replacing the missing ones, and we write here the model in a single line using a convenience feature that when the defaultcacheparameter is used in the model constructor thefit!` function returns itself the prediciton over the trained data:","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/Classification - cars/betaml_tutorial_classification_cars.html","page":"A classification task when labels are known - determining the country of origin of cars given the cars characteristics","title":"A classification task when labels are known - determining the country of origin of cars given the cars characteristics","text":"x = fit!(RFImputer(rng=copy(AFIXEDRNG)),x) # Same as `m = RFImputer(rng=copy(AFIXEDRNG)); fit!(m,x); x= predict(m,x)`","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/Classification - cars/betaml_tutorial_classification_cars.html","page":"A classification task when labels are known - determining the country of origin of cars given the cars characteristics","title":"A classification task when labels are known - determining the country of origin of cars given the cars characteristics","text":"Further, some models don't work with categorical data as well, so we need to represent our y as a matrix with a separate column for each possible categorical value (the so called \"one-hot\" representation).

So we need to provide them with the feature matrix \"clean\" of missing data. Secondly, they work only with numerical data. So we need to use the one-hot encoding we saw earlier.

There is no difference in BetaML about these kind of models, aside that the fitting (aka training) function for the former takes both the features and the labels.

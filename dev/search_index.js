Note that the interpretation of \"missing\" can be very wide.

The data with the missing values imputed can then be obtained with predict(mod). Useinfo(m::Imputer) to retrieve further information concerning the imputation. Trained models can be also used to impute missing values in new data with predict(mox,xNew).

Autotuning is then implemented in the (first) fit! call. Provided autotuning methods:  SuccessiveHalvingSearch (default), GridSearch\n\nSamplers\n\nUtilities to sample from data (e.g. for neural network training or for cross-validation)\nInclude the \"generic\" type SamplerWithData, together with the sampler implementation KFold and the function batch\n\nTransformers\n\nFuntions that \"transform\" a single input (that can be also a vector or a matrix)\nIncludes varios NN \"activation\" functions (relu, celu, sigmoid, softmax, pool1d) and their derivatives (d[FunctionName]), but also gini, entropy, variance, BIC, AIC\n\nMeasures\n\nSeveral functions of a pair of parameters (often y and ŷ) to measure the goodness of ŷ, the distance between the two elements of the pair, ...\nIncludes \"classical\" distance functions (l1_distance, l2_distance, l2squared_distance cosine_distance), \"cost\" functions for continuous variables (squared_cost, mean_relative_error) and comparision functions for multui-class variables (crossentropy, accuracy, ConfMatrix).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"Utils.html#Module-Index","page":"Utils","title":"Module Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Utils.html","page":"Utils","title":"Utils","text":"Modules = [Utils]\nOrder   = [:constant, :type, :function, :macro]\nPrivate = false","category":"page"},{"location":"Utils.html#Detailed-API","page":"Utils","title":"Detailed API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Utils.html","page":"Utils","title":"Utils","text":"Modules = [Utils]\nPrivate = false","category":"page"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.ConfMatrix","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.ConfMatrix","text":"ConfMatrix\n\nScores and measures resulting from a comparation between true and predicted categorical variables\n\nUse the function ConfMatrix(ŷ,y;classes,labels,rng) to build it and report(cm::ConfMatrix;what) to visualise it, or use the individual parts of interest, e.g. display(cm.scores).\n\nFields:\n\nlabels: Array of categorical labels\naccuracy: Overall accuracy rate\nmisclassification: Overall misclassification rate\nactual_count: Array of counts per lebel in the actual data\npredicted_count: Array of counts per label in the predicted data\nscores: Matrix actual (rows) vs predicted (columns)\nnormalised_scores: Normalised scores\ntp: True positive (by class)\ntn: True negative (by class)\nfp: False positive (by class), aka \"type I error\" or \"false allarm\"\nfn: False negative (by class), aka \"type II error\" or \"miss\"\nprecision: True class i over predicted class i (by class)\nrecall: Predicted class i over true class i (by class), aka \"True Positive Rate (TPR)\", \"Sensitivity\" or \"Probability of detection\"\nspecificity: Predicted not class i over true not class i (by class), aka \"True Negative Rate (TNR)\"\nf1score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall\nmean_precision: Mean by class, respectively unweighted and weighted by actual_count\nmean_recall: Mean by class, respectively unweighted and weighted by actual_count\nmean_specificity: Mean by class, respectively unweighted and weighted by actual_count\nmean_f1score: Mean by class, respectively unweighted and weighted by actual_count\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.ConfMatrix-Union{Tuple{T}, Tuple{AbstractArray{T, N} where N, Any}} where T","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.ConfMatrix","text":"ConfMatrix(y,ŷ;classes,labels,rng)\n\nBuild a \"confusion matrix\" between actual (rows) vs predicted (columns) categorical values\n\nParameters:\n\ny: Vector of actual categorical data\nŷ: Vector of predicted categorical data\nclasses: The full set of possible classes (useful to give a specicif order or if not al lclasses are represented in y) [def: unique(y) ]\nlabels: String representation of the classes [def: string.(classes)]\nrng: Random number generator.

However, if `returnstatisticsis left on its defaulttrue` value the user-defined function must return a single scalar (e.g. some error measure) so that the mean and the standard deviation are returned.\n\nNote that cross_validation can beconveniently be employed using the do syntax, as Julia automatically rewrite cross_validation(data,...) trainData,valData,rng  ...user defined body... end as cross_validation(f(trainData,valData,rng ), data,...)\n\nExample\n\njulia> X = [11:19 21:29 31:39 41:49 51:59 61:69];\njulia> Y = [1:9;];\njulia> sampler = KFold(nsplits=3);\njulia> (μ,σ) = cross_validation([X,Y],sampler) do trainData,valData,rng\n                 (xtrain,ytrain) = trainData; (xval,yval) = valData\n                 trainedModel    = buildForest(xtrain,ytrain,30)\n                 ŷval            = predict(trainedModel,xval)\n                 ϵ               = relative_mean_error(yval,ŷval,normrec=false)\n                 return ϵ\n               end\n(0.3202242202242202, 0.04307662219315022)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.crossentropy-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.crossentropy","text":"crossentropy(y,ŷ; weight)\n\nCompute the (weighted) cross-entropy between the predicted and the sampled probability distributions.\n\nTo be used in classification problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dcelu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dcelu","text":"dcelu(x; α=1) \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07483.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.delu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.delu","text":"delu(x; α=1) with α > 0 \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07289.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dmish-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dmish","text":"dmish(x) \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08681v1.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dplu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dplu","text":"dplu(x;α=0.1,c=1) \n\nPiecewise Linear Unit derivative \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09534.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.drelu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.drelu","text":"drelu(x) \n\nRectified Linear Unit \n\nhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/reluICML.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsigmoid-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsigmoid","text":"dsigmoid(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsoftmax-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsoftmax","text":"dsoftmax(x; β=1) \n\nDerivative of the softmax function \n\nhttps://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-softmax-function-and-its-derivative/\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dsoftplus-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dsoftplus","text":"dsoftplus(x) \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier(neuralnetworks)#Softplus\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.dtanh-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.dtanh","text":"dtanh(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.elu-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.elu","text":"elu(x; α=1) with α > 0 \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07289.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.entropy-Tuple{Any}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.entropy","text":"entropy(x)\n\nCalculate the entropy for a list of items (or rows).\n\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisiontreelearning#Gini_impurity\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"Utils.html#BetaML.Utils.generate_parallel_rngs-Tuple{Random.AbstractRNG, Integer}","page":"Utils","title":"BetaML.Utils.generate_parallel_rngs","text":"generate_parallel_rngs(rng::AbstractRNG, n::Integer;reSeed=false)\n\nFor multi-threaded models, return n independent random number generators (one per thread) to be used in threaded computations.\n\nNote that each ring is a copy of the original random ring.

For kmedoids they must be selected within one of the data, for kmeans they are the geometrical center) n a nutshell. Then ( b ) iterate for each point to assign the point to the cluster of the closest representative (according with a user defined distance metric, default to Euclidean), and ( c ) move each representative at the center of its newly acquired cluster (where \"center\" depends again from the metric). Steps ( b ) and ( c ) are reiterated until the algorithm converge, i.e. the tentative k representative points (and their relative clusters) don't move any more. The result (output of the algorithm) is that each point is assigned to one of the clusters (classes). The algorithm in GMMClusterer is similar in that it employs an iterative approach (the ExpectationMinimisation algorithm, \"em\") but here we make the hipothesis that the data points are the observed outcomes of some _mixture probabilistic models where we have first a k-categorical variables whose outcomes are the (unobservble) parameters of a probabilistic distribution from which the data is finally drawn. Because the parameters of each of the k-possible distributions is unobservable this is also called a model with latent variables. Most gmm models use the Gaussain distribution as the family of the mixture components, so we can tought the gmm acronym to indicate Gaussian Mixture Model. In BetaML we have currently implemented only Gaussain components, but any distribution could be used by just subclassing AbstractMixture and implementing a couple of methids (you are invited to contribute or just ask for a distribution family you are interested), so I prefer to think \"gmm\" as an acronym for Generative Mixture Model. The algorithm tries to find the mixture that maximises the likelihood that the data has been generated indeed from such mixture, where the \"E\" step refers to computing the probability that each point belongs to each of the k-composants (somehow similar to the step b in the kmeans/kmedoids algorithms), and the \"M\" step estimates, giving the association probabilities in step \"E\", the parameters of the mixture and of the individual components (similar to step c). The result here is that each point has a categorical distribution (PMF) representing the probabilities that it belongs to any of the k-components (our classes or clusters). This is interesting, as gmm can be used for many other things that clustering. It forms the backbone of the GMMImputer model to impute missing values (on some or all dimensions) based to how close the record seems to its pears. For the same reasons, GMMImputer can also be used to predict user's behaviours (or users' appreciation) according to the behaviour/ranking made by pears (\"collaborative filtering\"). While the result of GMMClusterer is a vector of PMFs (one for each record), error measures and reports with the true values (if known) can be directly applied, as in BetaML they internally call mode() to retrieve the class with the highest probability for each record.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/Clustering - Iris/betaml_tutorial_cluster_iris.html","page":"A clustering task: the prediction of  plant species from floreal measures (the iris dataset)","title":"A clustering task: the prediction of  plant species from floreal measures (the iris dataset)","text":"As we are here, we also try different versions of the BetaML models, even if the default \"versions\" should be fine.

Cross-Validation in BetaML is very flexible and it is done using the cross_validation function. It is used by default for hyperparameters autotuning of the BetaML supervised models. cross_validation works by calling the function f, defined by the user, passing to it the tuple trainData, valData and rng and collecting the result of the function f. The specific method for which trainData, and valData are selected at each iteration depends on the specific sampler. We start by selectign a k-fold sampler that split our data in 5 different parts, it uses 4 for training and 1 part (not used here) for validation.

Also, by default crossvalidation already returns the mean and the standard deviation of the output of the user-provided f function (or the do block). However this requires that the f function returns a single scalar.

Globally the accuracy of BetaML models are comparable to those of leading specialised packages (in this case they are even better), but there is a significant gap in computational efficiency that restricts the pratical usage of BetaML to datasets that fits in the pc memory.

Models as GMMImputer have the advantage over traditional algorithms as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) that GMM can \"detect\" the hidden structure of the observed data, where some observation can be similar to a certain pool of other observvations for a certain characteristic, but similar to an other pool of observations for other characteristics. Here we use RFImputer. While the model allows for reproducible multiple imputations (with the parameter multiple_imputation=an_integer) and multiple passages trough the various columns (fields) containing missing data (with the option recursive_passages=an_integer), we use here just a single imputation and a single passage. As all BetaML models, RFImputer follows the patters m=ModelConstruction(pars); fit!(m,x,[y]); est = predict(m,x) where est can be an estimation of some labels or be some characteristics of x itself (the imputed version, as in this case, a reprojected version as in PCA), depending if the model is supervised or not. See the API user documentationfor more details.

Unsupervised and transformer models relate to models that learn a \"structure\" from the data itself (without any label attached from which to learn) and report either some new information using this learned structure (e.g. a cluster class) or directly process a transformation of the data itself, like PCA or missing imputers. There is no difference in BetaML about these kind of models, aside that the fitting (aka training) function for the former takes both the features and the labels. In particular there isn't a separate transform function as in other frameworks, but any information we need to learn using the model, wheter a label or some transformation of the original data, is provided by the predict function.

$(TYPEDEF)

A Random Forest classifier and regressor (supervised).

Random forests are _ensemble_ of Decision Trees models (see [`?DecisionTreeEstimator`](@ref DecisionTreeEstimator)).

For the parameters see [`?RandomForestE_hp`](@ref RandomForestE_hp) and [`?BML_options`](@ref BML_options).

# Notes :
- Each individual decision tree is built using bootstrap over the data, i.e. "sampling N records with replacement" (hence, some records appear multiple times and some records do not appear in the specific tree training). The `maxx_feature` injects further variability and reduces the correlation between the forest trees.
- The predictions of the "forest" (using the function `predict()`) are then the aggregated predictions of the individual trees (from which the name "bagging": **b**oostrap **agg**regat**ing**).
- The performances of each individual trees,  as measured using the records they have not being trained with, can then be (optionally) used as weights in the `predict` function. The parameter `beta ≥ 0` regulate the distribution of these weights: larger is `β`, the greater the importance (hence the weights) attached to the best-performing trees compared to the low-performing ones. Using these weights can significantly improve the forest performances (especially using small forests), however the correct value of `beta` depends on the problem under exam (and the chosen caratteristics of the random forest estimator) and should be cross-validated to avoid over-fitting.
- Note that training `RandomForestEstimator` uses multiple threads if these are available. You can check the number of threads available with `Threads.nthreads()`. To set the number of threads in Julia either set the environmental variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` (before starting Julia) or start Julia with the command line option `--threads` (most integrated development editors for Julia already set the number of threads to 4).
- Online fitting (re-fitting with new data) is not supported
- Missing data (in the feature dataset) is supported.

"""
   buildForest(x, y, n_trees; max_depth, min_gain, min_records, max_features, splitting_criterion, force_classification)

Builds (define and train) a "forest" of Decision Trees.

!!! warning
    Direct usage of this low-level function is deprecated and it has been unexported in BetaML 0.9.
    Use [`RandomForestEstimator`](@ref) instead. 

# Parameters:
See [`buildTree`](@ref). The function has all the parameters of `bildTree` (with the `max_features` defaulting to `√D` instead of `D`) plus the following parameters:
- `n_trees`: Number of trees in the forest [def: `30`]
- `β`: Parameter that regulate the weights of the scoring of each tree, to be (optionally) used in prediction (see later) [def: `0`, i.e. uniform weigths]
- `oob`: Whether to coompute the out-of-bag error, an estimation of the generalization accuracy [def: `false`]
- `rng`: Random Number Generator (see [`FIXEDSEED`](@ref)) [deafult: `Random.GLOBAL_RNG`]

# Output:
- The function returns a Forest object.
- The forest weights default to array of ones if `β ≤ 0` and the oob error to `+Inf` if `oob` == `false`.

# Notes :
- Each individual decision tree is built using bootstrap over the data, i.e. "sampling N records with replacement" (hence, some records appear multiple times and some records do not appear in the specific tree training). The `maxFeature` injects further variability and reduces the correlation between the forest trees.
- The predictions of the "forest" (using the function `predict()`) are then the aggregated predictions of the individual trees (from which the name "bagging": **b**oostrap **agg**regat**ing**).
- This function optionally reports a weight distribution of the performances of eanch individual trees, as measured using the records he has not being trained with. These weights can then be (optionally) used in the `predict` function. The parameter `β ≥ 0` regulate the distribution of these weights: larger is `β`, the greater the importance (hence the weights) attached to the best-performing trees compared to the low-performing ones.

If the labels were categorical, the prediction is a dictionary with the probabilities of each item and in such case the probabilities of the different trees are averaged to compose the forest predictions. This is a bit different than most other implementations where the mode instead is reported.
